## 💡 Philosophy

**Internal Developer Portals should solve problems, not create them.**

- 🆓 Open source first
- ⚡ Performance-first architecture

- **10 hours/developer/month** saved
- **95%** compliance on day 1
- **<10 minutes** to production-ready repo (vs 2-3 days manual)

## 🎯 Stop Organizing. Start Automating.

Production-ready repos in **<15 minutes**. Intelligent automation over endless configuration.

**Built with ❤️ by developers, for developers who just want things to work.**
